+ '''Critical theory''' is a school of thought that stresses the reflective assessment and [[critique]] of [[society]] and [[culture]] by applying knowledge from the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. As a term, ''critical theory'' has two meanings with different origins and histories: the first originated in [[sociology]] and the second originated in [[literary criticism]], whereby it is used and applied as an [[umbrella term]] that can describe a theory founded upon [[critique]]; thus, the theorist [[Max Horkheimer]] described a theory as critical insofar as it seeks "to liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them." <ref>(Horkheimer 1982, 244)</ref>

In philosophy, the term ''critical theory'' describes the [[Western Marxism|neo-Marxist philosophy]] of the [[Frankfurt School]], which was developed in Germany in the 1930s. Frankfurt theorists drew on the critical methods of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. Critical theory maintains that [[ideology]] is the principal obstacle to human liberation.<ref>[Geuss, R. The Idea of a Critical Theory,Cambridge,Cambridge University Press]</ref> Critical theory was established as a school of thought primarily by five Frankfurt School theoreticians: [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Erich Fromm]]. Modern critical theory has been influenced by [[György Lukács]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] as well as the second generation Frankfurt School scholars, including [[Jürgen Habermas]]. In Habermas's work, critical theory transcended its theoretic roots in [[German idealism]], and progressed closer to [[Pragmatism|American pragmatism]]. Concern for social "[[base and superstructure]]" is one of the remaining [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]] philosophic concepts in much of the contemporary critical theory.<ref>Outhwaite, William. 1988. ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 2nd Edition (2009), p.5-8 (ISBN 978-0-7456-4328-1)</ref>

While critical theorists have been frequently defined as Marxist intellectuals<ref>See, e.g., [[Leszek Kolakowski]]'s ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'' (1979), vol. 3 chapter X; W. W. Norton & Company, ISBN 0393329437</ref> their tendency to denounce some Marxist concepts and to combine Marxian analysis with other sociologic and philosophic traditions has been labeled as [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] by [[Classical Marxism|Classical]], [[Orthodox Marxism|Orthodox]], and [[Analytical Marxism|Analytical]] Marxists, and by [[Marxist-Leninist]] philosophers. [[Martin Jay]] has stated that the first generation of critical theory is best understood as not promoting a specific philosophical agenda or a specific [[ideology]], but as "a [[Social gadfly|gadfly]] of other systems".<ref name="Martin Jay">Jay, Martin (1996) ''The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923–1950''.
