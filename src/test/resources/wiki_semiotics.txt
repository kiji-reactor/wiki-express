+ '''Semiotics''', also called '''semiotic studies''' and including (in the [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] tradition) '''semiology''', is the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and sign processes ([[semiosis]]), indication, designation, likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[symbol]]ism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of [[linguistics]], which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of [[language]] more specifically. However, as different from linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic [[sign systems]]. Semiotics is often divided into three branches:
* '''[[Semantics]]''': Relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their ''denotata'', or [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]
* '''[[Syntax|Syntactics]]''': Relations among signs in formal structures
* '''[[Pragmatics]]''': Relation between signs and sign-using agents

Semiotics is frequently seen as having important [[anthropology|anthropological]] dimensions; for example, [[Umberto Eco]] proposes that every cultural phenomenon can be studied as communication.<ref name=caesar>{{cite book |last= Caesar |first= Michael |title= ''Umberto Eco: Philosophy, Semiotics, and the Work of Fiction'' |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 1999 |isbn= 978-0-7456-0850-1 |page= 55}}</ref> However, some semioticians focus on the [[logic]]al dimensions of the science. They examine areas belonging also to the [[natural science]]s â€“ such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic [[ecological niche|niche]] in the world (see [[semiosis]]). In general, semiotic theories take ''signs'' or [[sign systems]] as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is covered in [[biosemiotics]] (including [[zoosemiotics]]).

Syntactics is the branch of semiotics that deals with the formal properties of signs and symbols.<ref>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/syntactics Syntactics]</ref>  More precisely, syntactics deals with the "rules that govern how words are combined to form phrases and sentences".<ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/syntax Wiktionary.org]</ref> [[Charles W. Morris|Charles Morris]] adds that semantics deals with the relation of signs to their [[reference#Semantics|designata]] and the objects which they may or do denote; and, pragmatics deals with the [[biotic]] aspects of semiosis, that is, with all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena which occur in the functioning of signs.
