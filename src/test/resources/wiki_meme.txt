''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''</ref> A meme acts as a unit for carrying [[culture|cultural]] ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to [[selection|selective pressures]].<ref>{{harvnb|Graham|2002}}</ref>

The word ''meme'' is a shortening (modeled on ''gene'') of ''mimeme'' (from [[Ancient Greek]] μίμημα {{IPA-el|míːmɛːma}} ''mīmēma'', "imitated thing", from μιμεῖσθαι ''mimeisthai'', "to imitate", from μῖμος ''mimos'' "mime")<ref>''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'': Fourth Edition, 2000</ref> and it was coined by the British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976)<ref name="cream"/><ref>{{harvnb|Millikan|2004|p=16}}; [http://books.google.com/books?id=YphlBwpbJCUC&pg=PA16 Varieties of meaning] "Richard Dawkins invented the term 'memes' to stand for items that are reproduced by imitation rather than reproduced genetically."</ref> as a concept for discussion of [[evolution]]ary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion, and the technology of building arches.<ref name="selfish">{{harvnb|Dawkins|1989 | p = 352}}</ref>

Proponents theorize that memes may evolve by [[natural selection]] in a manner analogous to that of [[biological evolution]]. Memes do this through the processes of [[genetic diversity|variation]], [[mutation]], [[competition]], and [[heredity|inheritance]], each of which influence a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that [[fecundity|propagate]] less prolifically may become [[extinction|extinct]], while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) [[mutation|mutate]]. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.<ref name="Kelly">{{harvnb|Kelly|1994 | p.360}}:"But if we consider culture as its own self-organizing system — a system with its own agenda and pressure to survive — then the history of humanity gets even more interesting. As Richard Dawkins has shown, systems of self-replicating ideas or memes can quickly accumulate their own agenda and behaviours. I assign no higher motive to a cultural entity than the primitive drive to reproduce itself and modify its environment to aid its spread. One way the self organizing system can do this is by consuming human biological resources."</ref>

A field of study called [[memetics]]<ref>{{harvnb |Heylighen|Chielens|2009}}</ref> arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an [[evolutionary model]]. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes [[empirical]]ly. However, developments in [[Functional neuroimaging|neuroimaging]] may make [[empirical]] study possible.<ref name="mcnamara">{{harvnb|McNamara|2011}}</ref> Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings<ref>GILL, Jameson (2011).
